The DriverPass project is a system design request by the DriverPass corporation, who is the client. Their request was to create a system they can use to help driving students have an easier way to register for driving classes online, to help advance their skills and pass their driving exams. One part of these documents that would be wise to revise, would be to add more specific detail to the UML diagrams that were created. In order to implement the users needs into the design, I payed specific attention to the the CEO and I.T. manager of the company requested. As well as provide addition aspects to the design which needed to be implemented. When designing a system it is imperitive to consider the users needs because they have a vision and expectation of what they would like their systen to be, and we are the ones who are tasked with bringing that vision to reality.
